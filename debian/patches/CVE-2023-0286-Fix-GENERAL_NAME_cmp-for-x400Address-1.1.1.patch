    Fixed a type confusion vulnerability relating to X.400 address processing
    inside an X.509 GeneralName. X.400 addresses were parsed as an ASN1_STRING
    but subsequently interpreted by GENERAL_NAME_cmp as an ASN1_TYPE. This
    vulnerability may allow an attacker who can provide a certificate chain and
    CRL (neither of which need have a valid signature) to pass arbitrary
    pointers to a memcmp call, creating a possible read primitive, subject to
    some constraints. Refer to the advisory for more information. Thanks to
    David Benjamin for discovering this issue. (CVE-2023-0286)

    This issue has been fixed by changing the public header file definition of
    GENERAL_NAME so that x400Address reflects the implementation. It was not
    possible for any existing application to successfully use the existing
    definition; however, if any application references the x400Address field
    (e.g. in dead code), note that the type of this field has changed. There is
    no ABI change.
